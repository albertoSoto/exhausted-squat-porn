# 累屎人深蹲謎片 Exhausted Squat NSFW ( Machine Learning PoseNet + P5 )

累屎人深蹲謎片 Exhausted Squat NSFW is a web app that I used as a self-challenge exercise tool. The machine learning Tensorflow model - PoseNet allows to recognize the human poses from simple camera without any other sensor.
By feeding the output coordinate data with label, I can even train my own custom model.
In this project, doing squat is the main target pose that can trigger the video to play the pleasant content.
